## What is CocosAI

CoCoS.ai is a distributed, microservice-based solution in the cloud that enables confidential and privacy-preserving AI/ML, i.e. execution of model training and algorithm inference on confidential data sets. Privacy-preservation is considered a “holy grail” of AI. It opens many possibilities, among which is a collaborative, trustworthy AI.Final product enables data scientists to train AI and ML models on confidential data that is never revealed, and can be used for Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). AI/ML on combined data sets that come from different sources will unlock huge value.
